# Simple Paddle

A small Pong clone made in C++ and SFML.

(**Please don't sue me**, this was for educational purposes)

I made this project as a very first stepping stone to learning SFML. 

The font I used for the scores is *Imagine Font* by Jooki 
([dafont.com](http://www.dafont.com/imagine-font.font)).

If you decide to play, the controls are as follows:

Player 1: UP (`q`), DOWN (`a`)

Player 2: UP (`up arrow`), DOWN (`down arrow`)
